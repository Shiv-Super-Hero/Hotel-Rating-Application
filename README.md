This project demonstrates a robust microservices architecture comprising UserService, RatingService, and HotelService. Each service is independently developed and deployed to promote scalability and maintainability. To enable dynamic service discovery, we integrated Eureka Server as a service registry, allowing all microservices to register themselves and communicate continuously. We used Feign Client to simplify inter-service communication with declarative REST clients. An API Gateway was implemented using Spring Cloud Gateway to act as a single entry point, handling routing, security, and request filtering. To manage centralized configuration across microservices, we integrated a Spring Cloud Config Server, sourcing configuration files directly from GitHub, ensuring consistency and ease of updates. For fault tolerance and resilience, we leveraged Resilience4j, implementing Circuit Breaker and Retry mechanisms to handle service failures gracefully. We also integrated Rate Limiting using Resilience4j to protect services from abuse, thoroughly tested using JMeter. Lastly, we applied Spring Security at the gateway level and integrated OKTA for OAuth2-based authentication, ensuring secure access control to all microservice endpoints.
